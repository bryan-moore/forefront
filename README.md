## Forefront
Hey there!

This is a basic framework that I use that brings together a collection of web
technologies that I have come to like. It is constantly evolving and improving.

To get it up and going, you will need
- npm (to get all the grunt packages)
- grunt-cli (automation wahoo!)
- bower (for typescript definitions)
- a simple http server of your liking to run the site
- TypeScript (modules wrapping and variable typing)

Additonal notes
- RequireJS is used for the conditional loading of modules
- 

If you have any suggestions for improvement, make a pull request!
