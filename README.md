Hey guys!

Looks like you found my little demo project for the SthlmJS meetup.

It is basically a starting framework for websites using Grunt and Require.js.

To get it up and going, you will need
- npm (to get all the grunt packages)
- grunt-cli
- bower (for typescript definitions)
- a simple http server of your liking to run the site

If you have any suggestions for improvement, make a pull request!
